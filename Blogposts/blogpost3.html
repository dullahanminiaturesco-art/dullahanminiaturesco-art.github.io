                <p>To begin the project proposal that I aim continuing to follow through on is to create a set of 4
                    men-at-artms models that can be used for either wargames or tabletop-rpg systems. The models will
                    take some inspiration from house blackwood of a song of ice and fire for their theme or tone. As the
                    current research unfolds I currently use the official song of ice and fire miniatures for the
                    miniatures game as a basis on where I should lead the design of the men-at-arms. So far I've decided
                    to take a more rustic/rugged approach to their design. I plan to also have them wear a form of
                    kettle helm mainly to the fact it reminds of straw hats which can lead to them looking like
                    scarecrows which in a way fits thematically since one of the symbols for house blackwood is a raven.
                    For the other segments of the armor I plan to keep them simple to keep the rugged look to them. As
                    of now I am currently creating the concept art for the miniatures.</p>
