                <p>So far I've been struggling to keep up the schedule that I've created at beginning of the semester.
                    It's mainly due to the fact that I've been having to try and experiment with different techniques.
                    Such as trying to combine some technique of sculpting and hard surface modeling so they can look
                    like metal without having giving the feel that it's not hand sculpted So far I've been consulting
                    with one of my professor on how best to tackle some aspects of this miniature as well as making a
                    custom alpha to use as a coat-at-arms on the banner plus shields.</p>
